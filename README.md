# Vim-Ham-Syntax
Syntax highlighting for common amateur radio log filetypes.

## Syntax
This syntax highlighting should work for ADIF and Cabrillo files, both of which
are common contact log file formats.

This plugin will automatically apply the syntax highlighting to files named `*.adif` or `*.cbr`.

## Installation
Copy the included folders to your $VIM folder.

For per-user basis, this is typically `~/.vim/`

For system-wide, this is typically `/usr/share/vim/vimfiles/`
